rel="noopener" is used when a link opens in a new tab (target="_blank").

It stops the new tab from having access to your original page through JavaScript.
Without it, the new tab could change or hijack the page that opened it (a security risk called tabnabbing).

ðŸ‘‰ In short: noopener = protects your original page from being controlled by the new tab.
